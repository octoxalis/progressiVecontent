Declarations are most commonly used for <mark data-tag="TAG">functions</mark>, <mark data-tag="TAG">variables</mark>, <mark data-tag="TAG">constants</mark>, and <mark data-tag="TAG">classes</mark>, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions. Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the <mark data-tag="TAG">data type</mark> (for variables and constants), or the <mark data-tag="TAG">type signature</mark> (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays. A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the <mark data-tag="TAG">compiler</mark>; this is important in those <mark data-tag="TAG">strongly typed</mark> languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types, to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in <mark data-tag="TAG">forward declaration</mark>. The term “declaration” is frequently contrasted with the term “definition”, but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/declaration.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
