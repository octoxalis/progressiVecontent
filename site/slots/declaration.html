Declarations are most commonly used for <b data-tag="TAG">functions</b>, <b data-tag="TAG">variables</b>, <b data-tag="TAG">constants</b>, and <b data-tag="TAG">classes</b>, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions. Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the <b data-tag="TAG">data type</b> (for variables and constants), or the <b data-tag="TAG">type signature</b> (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays. A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the <b data-tag="TAG">compiler</b>; this is important in those <b data-tag="TAG">strongly typed</b> languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types, to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in <b data-tag="TAG">forward declaration</b>. The term “declaration” is frequently contrasted with the term “definition”, but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/declaration.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
