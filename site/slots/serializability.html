Transactions are normally executed concurrently (they overlap), since this is the most efficient way. Serializability is the major correctness criterion for concurrent transactionsâ€™ executions<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><mark data-tag="TAG">citation needed</mark></i>]</sup>.
