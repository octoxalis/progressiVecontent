A graph in this context is made up of <i><mark data-tag="TAG">vertices</mark></i> (also called <i>nodes</i> or <i>points</i>) which are connected by <i><mark data-tag="TAG">edges</mark></i> (also called <i>links</i> or <i>lines</i>). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically.</p></article><a href="https://progressivecontent.netlify.app/?s=/slots/graph_theory.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
