A feature of objects is an object’s procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of “<b data-tag="TAG">this</b>” or “self”). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are <b data-tag="TAG">class-based</b>, meaning that objects are <b data-tag="TAG">instances</b> of <b data-tag="TAG">classes</b>, which also determine their <b data-tag="TAG">types</b>.</p></article><a href="https://progressivecontent.netlify.app/?s=/slots/object-oriented_programming_(oop).html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
