Like a <mark data-tag="TAG">set</mark>, it contains <mark data-tag="TAG">members</mark> (also called <i>elements</i>, or <i>terms</i>). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the <i>length</i> of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order does matter. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a <mark data-tag="TAG">function</mark> whose domain is either the set of the <mark data-tag="TAG">natural numbers</mark> (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first <i>n</i> natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length <i>n</i>).</p><p>The position of an element in a sequence is its <i>rank</i> or <i>index</i>; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. When a symbol is used to denote a sequence, the <i>n</i>th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with <i>n</i> as subscript; for example, the <i>n</i>th element of the <mark data-tag="TAG">Fibonacci sequence</mark> <i>F</i> is generally denoted <i>F</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>.</p><p>For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter ‘M’ first and ‘Y’ last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be <i><mark data-tag="TAG">finite</mark></i>, as in these examples, or <i><mark data-tag="TAG">infinite</mark></i>, such as the sequence of all <mark data-tag="TAG">even</mark> <mark data-tag="TAG">positive integers</mark> (2, 4, 6, …). In <mark data-tag="TAG">computing</mark> and <mark data-tag="TAG">computer science</mark>, finite sequences are sometimes called <mark data-tag="TAG">strings</mark>, <mark data-tag="TAG">words</mark> or <mark data-tag="TAG">lists</mark>, the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in <mark data-tag="TAG">computer memory</mark>; infinite sequences are called <mark data-tag="TAG">streams</mark>. The empty sequence ( ) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/#//slots/sequence.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1">Go to Site Open</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
