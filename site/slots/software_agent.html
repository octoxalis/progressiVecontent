Such “action on behalf of” implies the <b data-tag="TAG">authority</b> to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Agents are colloquially known as <i><b data-tag="TAG">bots</b></i>, from <i><b data-tag="TAG">robot</b></i>. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or as software such as a chatbot executing on a phone (e.g. <b data-tag="TAG">Siri</b>) or other computing device. Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Software agents interacting with people (e.g. <b data-tag="TAG">chatbots</b>, <b data-tag="TAG">human-robot interaction</b> environments) may possess human-like qualities such as <b data-tag="TAG">natural language understanding</b> and speech, personality or embody humanoid form (see <b data-tag="TAG">Asimo</b>).</p></article><a href="https://progressivecontent.netlify.app/?s=/slots/software_agent.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
