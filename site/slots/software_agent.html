Such “action on behalf of” implies the <mark data-tag="TAG">authority</mark> to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Agents are colloquially known as <i><mark data-tag="TAG">bots</mark></i>, from <i><mark data-tag="TAG">robot</mark></i>. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or as software such as a chatbot executing on a phone (e.g. <mark data-tag="TAG">Siri</mark>) or other computing device.
