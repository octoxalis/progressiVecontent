It does so by evaluating the meaning of <b data-tag="TAG">syntactically</b> valid <b data-tag="TAG">strings</b> defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain <b data-tag="TAG">platform</b>, hence creating a <b data-tag="TAG">model of computation</b>.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/semantics.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
