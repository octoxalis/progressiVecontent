Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, <b data-tag="TAG">Internet service providers</b> and <b data-tag="TAG">telcos</b> will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in <i><b data-tag="TAG">mean time between failures</b></i> (MTBF), <i><b data-tag="TAG">mean time to repair</b></i> or <i><b data-tag="TAG">mean time to recovery</b></i> (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; <b data-tag="TAG">throughput</b>; <b data-tag="TAG">jitter</b>; or similar measurable details.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/service_level_agreement.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
