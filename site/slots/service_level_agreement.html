Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, <mark data-tag="TAG">Internet service providers</mark> and <mark data-tag="TAG">telcos</mark> will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in <i><mark data-tag="TAG">mean time between failures</mark></i> (MTBF), <i><mark data-tag="TAG">mean time to repair</mark></i> or <i><mark data-tag="TAG">mean time to recovery</mark></i> (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; <mark data-tag="TAG">throughput</mark>; <mark data-tag="TAG">jitter</mark>; or similar measurable details.</p></article><a href="https://progressivecontent.netlify.app/?s=/slots/service_level_agreement.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
