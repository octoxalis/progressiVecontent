The computer usually uses its <mark data-tag="TAG">input/output</mark> channels to access secondary storage and transfer the desired data to primary storage. Secondary storage is non-volatile (retaining data when power is shut off). Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage because secondary storage is less expensive.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/secondary_storage.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
