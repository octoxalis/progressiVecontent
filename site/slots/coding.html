Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating <mark data-tag="TAG">algorithms</mark>, profiling algorithmsâ€™ accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen <mark data-tag="TAG">programming language</mark> (commonly referred to as <b>coding</b>). The <mark data-tag="TAG">source code</mark> of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the <mark data-tag="TAG">application domain</mark>, specialized algorithms, and formal <mark data-tag="TAG">logic</mark>.</p></article><a href="https://progressivecontent.netlify.app/#//slots/coding.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1">This content belongs to progressiVecontent site.
