Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating <b data-tag="TAG">algorithms</b>, profiling algorithmsâ€™ accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen <b data-tag="TAG">programming language</b> (commonly referred to as <b>coding</b>). The <b data-tag="TAG">source code</b> of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the <b data-tag="TAG">application domain</b>, specialized algorithms, and formal <b data-tag="TAG">logic</b>.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/coding.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
