A <i>distributed system</i> is a system whose components are located on different <b data-tag="TAG">networked computers</b>, which communicate and coordinate their actions by <b data-tag="TAG">passing messages</b> to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, <b data-tag="TAG">lack of a global clock</b>, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from <b data-tag="TAG">SOA-based systems</b> to <b data-tag="TAG">massively multiplayer online games</b> to <b data-tag="TAG">peer-to-peer applications</b>.</p></article><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/?s=/slots/distributed_computing.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
