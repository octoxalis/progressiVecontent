A <i>distributed system</i> is a system whose components are located on different <mark data-tag="TAG">networked computers</mark>, which communicate and coordinate their actions by <mark data-tag="TAG">passing messages</mark> to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, <mark data-tag="TAG">lack of a global clock</mark>, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from <mark data-tag="TAG">SOA-based systems</mark> to <mark data-tag="TAG">massively multiplayer online games</mark> to <mark data-tag="TAG">peer-to-peer applications</mark>.</p></article><a href="https://progressivecontent.netlify.app/?s=/slots/distributed_computing.html" data-id="redirect" tabindex="-1"><br/>This content is part of <em>progressiVecontent</em> site</a><script data-node="Link" data-list="slot"></script></section>
