:round-off error:
The difference between the result produced by a given ~°algorithm°~ using exact arithmetic and the result produced by the same algorithm using finite-precision, rounded arithmetic. Rounding errors are due to inexactness in the representation of real numbers and the arithmetic operations done with them. This is a form of ~°quantization error°~. When using approximation ~°equations°~ or algorithms, especially when using finitely many digits to represent real numbers (which in theory have infinitely many digits), one of the goals of ~°numerical analysis°~ is to ~°estimate°~ computation errors. Computation errors, also called ~°numerical errors°~, include both ~°truncation errors°~ and roundoff errors.
