## software

Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of ~°data°~ or ~°computer°~ instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to ~°physical hardware°~, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In ~°computer science°~ and ~°software engineering°~, computer software is all ~°information°~ processed by ~°computer systems°~, ~°programs°~ and ~°data°~. Computer software includes ~°computer programs°~, ~°libraries°~ and related non-executable ~°data°~, such as ~°online documentation°~ or ~°digital media°~. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
