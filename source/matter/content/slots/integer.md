## integer

A datum of integral data type, a ~°data type°~ that represents some ~°range°~ of mathematical ~°integers°~. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including ~°virtual machines°~, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor ~°register°~ or memory address as an integer.
