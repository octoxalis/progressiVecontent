## loader

The part of an ~°operating system°~ that is responsible for loading ~°programs°~ and ~°libraries°~. It is one of the essential stages in the process of starting a program, as it places programs into memory and prepares them for execution. Loading a program involves reading the contents of the ~°executable file°~ containing the program instructions into memory, and then carrying out other required preparatory tasks to prepare the executable for running. Once loading is complete, the operating system starts the program by passing control to the loaded program code.
