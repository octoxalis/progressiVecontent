## recursion

Occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from ~°linguistics°~ to ~°logic°~. The most common application of recursion is in ~°mathematics°~ and ~°computer science°~, where a ~°function°~ being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references can occur.
