## precondition

In ~°computer programming°~, a condition or ~°predicate°~ that must always be true just prior to the execution of some section of ~°code°~ or before an operation in a ~°formal specification°~.  If a precondition is violated, the effect of the section of ~°code°~ becomes undefined and thus may or may not carry out its intended work.  ~°Security°~ problems can arise due to incorrect preconditions.
