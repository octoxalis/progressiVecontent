## boolean algebra

In mathematics and ~°mathematical logic°~, the branch of ~°algebra°~ in which the values of the variables are the ~°truth values°~ <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>, usually denoted 1 and 0, respectively. Contrary to ~°elementary algebra°~, where the values of the variables are numbers and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the ~°conjunction°~ <i>and</i> (denoted as ∧), the ~°disjunction°~ <i>or</i> (denoted as ∨), and the ~°negation°~ <i>not</i> (denoted as ¬). It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that elementary algebra describes numeric relations.
