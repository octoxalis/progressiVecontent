## imperative programming

A ~°programming paradigm°~ that uses ~°statements°~ that change a program's ~°state°~. In much the same way that the ~°imperative mood°~ in ~°natural languages°~ expresses commands, an imperative program consists of ~°commands°~ for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing <i>how</i> a program operates.
