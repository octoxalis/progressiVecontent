## reliability engineering

A sub-discipline of ~°systems engineering°~ that emphasizes dependability in the ~°lifecycle management°~ of a product. Reliability describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Reliability is closely related to ~°availability°~, which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time.
