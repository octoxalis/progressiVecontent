## computer programming

The process of designing and building an ~°executable°~ ~°computer program°~ for accomplishing a specific ~°computing°~ task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating ~°algorithms°~, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen ~°programming language°~ (commonly referred to as <b>coding</b>). The ~°source code°~ of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the ~°application domain°~, specialized algorithms, and formal ~°logic°~.
