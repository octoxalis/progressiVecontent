## inheritance

In ~°object-oriented programming°~, the mechanism of basing an ~°object°~ or ~°class°~ upon another object (~°prototype-based inheritance°~) or class (~°class-based inheritance°~), retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (~°sub classes°~) from existing ones (super class or ~°base class°~) and forming them into a hierarchy of classes.
