:event:
An action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating ~째asynchronously째~ from the external environment, that may be ~째handled째~ by the software. Because an event is an entity which encapsulates the action and the contextual variables triggering the action, the acrostic mnemonic "<b>E</b>xecution <b>V</b>ariable <b>E</b>ncapsulating <b>N</b>amed <b>T</b>rigger" is often used to clarify the concept.
