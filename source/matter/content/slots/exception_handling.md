## exception handling

The process of responding to the occurrence, during ~°computation°~, of <i>exceptions</i> – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – often disrupting the normal flow of ~°program°~ ~°execution°~. It is provided by specialized ~°programming language°~ constructs, ~°computer hardware°~ mechanisms like ~°interrupts°~, or ~°operating system°~ ~°IPC°~ facilities like ~°signals°~.
