## object-oriented programming (oop)

A ~°programming paradigm°~ based on the concept of "~°objects°~", which can contain ~°data°~, in the form of ~°fields°~ (often known as <i>attributes</i> or <i>properties</i>), and code, in the form of ~°procedures°~ (often known as <i>methods</i>). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "~°this°~" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are ~°class-based°~, meaning that objects are ~°instances°~ of ~°classes°~, which also determine their ~°types°~.
