## formal methods

A set of mathematically based techniques for the ~°specification°~, development, and ~°verification°~ of ~°software°~ and ~°hardware°~ systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.
