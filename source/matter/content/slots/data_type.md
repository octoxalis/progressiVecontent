:data type:
An attribute of ~°data°~ which tells the ~°compiler°~ or ~°interpreter°~ how the programmer intends to use the data. Most ~°programming languages°~ support common data types of ~°real°~, ~°integer°~, and ~°Boolean°~. A data type constrains the values that an ~°expression°~, such as a ~°variable°~ or a ~°function°~, might take. This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. A type of value from which an expression may take its value.
