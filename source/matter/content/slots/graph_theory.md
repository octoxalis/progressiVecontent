## graph theory

In mathematics, the study of <i>~°graphs°~</i>, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of <i>~°vertices°~</i> (also called <i>nodes</i> or <i>points</i>) which are connected by <i>~°edges°~</i> (also called <i>links</i> or <i>lines</i>). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically.
