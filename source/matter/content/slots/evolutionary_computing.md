:evolutionary computing:
A family of ~°algorithms°~ for ~°global optimization°~ inspired by ~°biological evolution°~, and the subfield of ~°artificial intelligence°~ and ~°soft computing°~ studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial-and-error problem-solvers with a ~°metaheuristic°~ or ~°stochastic optimization°~ character.
