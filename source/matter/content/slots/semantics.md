## semantics

In ~°programming language theory°~, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of ~°programming languages°~. It does so by evaluating the meaning of ~°syntactically°~ valid ~°strings°~ defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain ~°platform°~, hence creating a ~°model of computation°~.
