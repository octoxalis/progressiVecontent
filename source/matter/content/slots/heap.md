## heap

A specialized ~°tree°~-based ~°data structure°~ which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the <i>heap property:</i> if P is a parent ~°node°~ of C, then the <i>key</i> (the <i>value</i>) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a <i>max heap</i>) or less than or equal to (in a <i>min heap</i>) the key of C. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the <i>root</i> node.
