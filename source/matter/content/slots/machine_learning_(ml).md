:machine learning (ml):
The scientific study of ~°algorithms°~ and ~°statistical models°~ that ~°computer systems°~ use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and ~°inference°~ instead. It is seen as a subset of ~°artificial intelligence°~. Machine learning algorithms build a ~°mathematical model°~ based on sample data, known as "~°training data°~", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
