## list

An ~°abstract data type°~ that represents a countable number of ordered ~°values°~, where the same value may occur more than once. An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a finite ~°sequence°~; the (potentially) infinite analog of a list is a ~°stream°~.<sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:§3.5</sup> Lists are a basic example of ~°containers°~, as they contain other values. If the same value occurs multiple times, each occurrence is considered a distinct item.
