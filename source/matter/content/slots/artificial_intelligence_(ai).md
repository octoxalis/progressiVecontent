:artificial intelligence (ai):
~°Intelligence°~ demonstrated by ~°machines°~, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In ~°computer science°~, AI research is defined as the study of "~°intelligent agents°~": devices capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions that maximize the chance of successfully achieving their goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other ~°human minds°~, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
