:object:
An object can be a ~°variable°~, a ~°data structure°~, a ~°function°~, or a ~°method°~, and as such, is a ~°value°~ in ~°memory°~ referenced by an ~°identifier°~.  In the ~°class-based°~ ~°object-oriented programming°~ paradigm, <i>object</i> refers to a particular ~°instance°~ of a ~°class°~, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.  In ~°relational°~ ~°database°~ management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person).
