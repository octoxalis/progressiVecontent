## expression

In a ~°programming language°~, a combination of one or more ~°constants°~, ~°variables°~, ~°operators°~, and ~°functions°~ that the programming language interprets (according to its particular ~°rules of precedence°~ and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a ~°stateful°~ environment) another value. This process, as for ~°mathematical expressions°~, is called evaluation.
