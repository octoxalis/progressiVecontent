## distributed computing

A field of ~°computer science°~ that studies distributed systems. A <i>distributed system</i> is a system whose components are located on different ~°networked computers°~, which communicate and coordinate their actions by ~°passing messages°~ to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, ~°lack of a global clock°~, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from ~°SOA-based systems°~ to ~°massively multiplayer online games°~ to ~°peer-to-peer applications°~.
