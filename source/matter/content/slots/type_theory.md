## type theory

In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class of ~°formal systems°~, some of which can serve as alternatives to ~°set theory°~ as a ~°foundation for all mathematics°~. In type theory, every "term" has a "type" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.
