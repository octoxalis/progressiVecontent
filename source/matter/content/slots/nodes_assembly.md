:graph nodes assembly:
During the ~°building phase°~ of the ~°site°~, all ~°content components°~ are analyzed in order to identify their ~°specificities°~ and trace ~°analogies°~ linking their ~°thematic content°~.


This phase, using ~°natural language processing°~ ~°algorithms°~, makes it possible to group the ~°components°~ together by assigning them ~°meaningful labels°~
in order to ~°identify°~ characteristic ~°semantic relations°~ enabling an ~°heuristic exploration°~ of the ~°overall content°~ of the ~°site°~.


Hence, it is no longer a question of a ~°content°~, whose ~°structure°~ is completely frozen by the ~°author°~ of the ~°page°~,
but a question of ~°dynamic composition°~ of ~°fragments°~
{% _note_txt  %}
which can be as long as the component author wishes, but it's better to keep them short to load them very quickly, as not to break the fluidity of reading, watching or browsing
{% end_note_txt %}
, ~°concentrated°~ around a ~°semantically°~ ~°homogeneous meaning°~,
that the ~°site°~ ~°visitor°~ ~°assembles°~, according to its own ~°search°~ for ~°information°~
{% _note_txt  %}
or ~°entertainment°~, or any other purpose
{% end_note_txt %}
criteria.
