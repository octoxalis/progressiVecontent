:pair programming:
An ~°agile software development°~ technique in which two ~°programmers°~ work together at one workstation. One, the <i>driver</i>, writes ~°code°~ while the other, the <i>observer</i> or <i>navigator</i>, ~°reviews°~ each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
