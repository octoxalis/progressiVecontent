:merge sort:
An efficient, general-purpose, ~°comparison-based°~ ~°sorting algorithm°~. Most implementations produce a ~°stable sort°~, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a ~°divide and conquer algorithm°~ that was invented by ~°John von Neumann°~ in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by ~°Goldstine°~ and ~°von Neumann°~ as early as 1948.
