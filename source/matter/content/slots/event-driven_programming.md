## event-driven programming

A ~°programming paradigm°~ in which the ~°flow of the program°~ is determined by ~°events°~ such as user actions (~°mouse°~ clicks, key presses), ~°sensor°~ outputs, or ~°messages°~ from other programs or ~°threads°~. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in ~°graphical user interfaces°~ and other applications (e.g. JavaScript ~°web applications°~) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to ~°user input°~. This is also true of programming for ~°device drivers°~ (e.g. ~°P°~ in USB device driver stacks).
