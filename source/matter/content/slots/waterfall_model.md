## waterfall model

A breakdown of project activities into linear ~°sequential°~ phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks.  The approach is typical for certain areas of ~°engineering design°~. In ~°software development°~, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a ~°waterfall°~) through the phases of conception, initiation, ~°analysis°~, ~°design°~, ~°construction°~, ~°testing°~, ~°deployment°~ and ~°maintenance°~.
