## assertion

In ~°computer programming°~, a ~°statement°~ that a ~°predicate°~ (~°Boolean-valued function°~, i.e. a true–false ~°expression°~) is always true at that point in code execution. It can help a programmer read the code, help a ~°compiler°~ compile it, or help the program detect its own defects. For the latter, some programs check assertions by actually evaluating the predicate as they run and if it is not in fact true – an assertion failure – the program considers itself to be broken and typically deliberately ~°crashes°~ or throws an assertion failure ~°exception°~.
