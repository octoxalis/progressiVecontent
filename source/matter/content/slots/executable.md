## executable

Causes a computer "to perform indicated tasks according to encoded ~°instructions°~," as opposed to a ~°data file°~ that must be ~°parsed°~ by a program to be meaningful. The exact interpretation depends upon the use - while "instructions" is traditionally taken to mean ~°machine code°~ instructions for a physical ~°CPU°~, in some contexts a file containing ~°bytecode°~ or ~°scripting language°~ instructions may also be considered executable.
