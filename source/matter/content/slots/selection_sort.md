## selection sort

Is an ~°in-place°~ ~°comparison°~ ~°sorting algorithm°~. It has an ~°O°~(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) ~°time complexity°~, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar ~°insertion sort°~. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where ~°auxiliary memory°~ is limited.
