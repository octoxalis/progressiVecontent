## incremental build model

A method of ~°software development°~ where the product is ~°designed°~, implemented and ~°tested°~ incrementally (a little more is added each time) until the product is finished. It involves both development and maintenance. The product is defined as finished when it satisfies all of its requirements. This model combines the elements of the ~°waterfall model°~ with the iterative philosophy of ~°prototyping°~.
