## postcondition

In ~°computer programming°~, a condition or ~°predicate°~ that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a ~°formal specification°~. Postconditions are sometimes tested using ~°assertions°~ within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.
