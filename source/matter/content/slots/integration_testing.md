## integration testing

(sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&amp;T) is the phase in ~°software testing°~ in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the ~°compliance°~ of a system or component with specified ~°functional requirements°~. It occurs after ~°unit testing°~ and before ~°validation testing°~. Integration testing takes as its input ~°modules°~ that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration ~°test plan°~ to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for ~°system testing°~.
