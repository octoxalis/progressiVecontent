## human-computer interaction (hci)

Researches the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people (~°users°~) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. As a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of ~°computer science°~, ~°behavioral sciences°~, ~°design°~, ~°media studies°~, and ~°several other fields of study°~.
