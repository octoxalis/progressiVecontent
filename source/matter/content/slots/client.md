## client

A piece of ~°computer hardware°~ or ~°software°~ that accesses a service made available by a ~°server°~. The server is often (but not always) on another ~°computer system°~, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a ~°network°~. The term applies to the role that programs or devices play in the ~°client–server model°~.
