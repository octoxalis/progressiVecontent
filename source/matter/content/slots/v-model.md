## v-model

A ~°software development process°~ that may be considered an extension of the ~°waterfall model°~, and is an example of the more ~°general V-model°~. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the ~°coding°~ phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of ~°testing°~. The horizontal and vertical axes represent time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.
