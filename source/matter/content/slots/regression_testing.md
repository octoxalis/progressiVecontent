## regression testing

(rarely <i>non-regression testing</i>) is re-running ~°functional°~ and ~°non-functional tests°~ to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. If not, that would be called a <i>~°regression°~</i>. Changes that may require regression testing include ~°bug°~ fixes, software enhancements, ~°configuration°~ changes, and even substitution of ~°electronic components°~. As regression test suites tend to grow with each found defect, test automation is frequently involved. Sometimes a ~°change impact analysis°~ is performed to determine an appropriate subset of tests (<i>non-regression analysis</i>).
