A ~°basic unit of information°~ used in ~°computing°~ and digital communications; a portmanteau of <i>binary digit</i>. A ~°binary°~ digit can have one of two possible ~°values°~, and may be physically represented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either a 0or1.
