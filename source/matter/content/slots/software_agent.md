## software agent

Is a computer program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency, which derives from the Latin <i>agere</i> (to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such "action on behalf of" implies the ~°authority°~ to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Agents are colloquially known as <i>~°bots°~</i>, from <i>~°robot°~</i>. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or  as software such as a chatbot
executing on a phone (e.g. ~°Siri°~)  or other computing device.  Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people.  Software agents interacting with people (e.g. ~°chatbots°~, ~°human-robot interaction°~ environments) may possess human-like qualities such as ~°natural language understanding°~ and speech, personality or embody humanoid form (see ~°Asimo°~).
