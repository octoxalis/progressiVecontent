## object code

The product of a ~°compiler°~. In a general sense object code is a sequence of ~°statements°~ or instructions in a computer language, usually a ~°machine code°~ language (i.e., ~°binary°~) or an intermediate language such as ~°register transfer language°~ (RTL). The term indicates that the code is the ~°goal°~ or result of the compiling process, with some early sources referring to source code as a "subject program."
