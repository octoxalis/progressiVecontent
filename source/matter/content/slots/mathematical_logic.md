## mathematical logic

A subfield of ~°mathematics°~ exploring the applications of formal ~°logic°~ to mathematics.  It bears close connections to ~°metamathematics°~, the ~°foundations of mathematics°~, and ~°theoretical computer science°~. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of ~°formal systems°~ and the ~°deductive°~ power of formal ~°proof°~ systems.
