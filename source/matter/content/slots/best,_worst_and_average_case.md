:best, worst and average case:
Expressions of what the ~°resource°~ usage is <i>at least</i>, <i>at most</i>, and <i>on average</i>, respectively, for a given ~°algorithm°~. Usually the resource being considered is running time, i.e. ~°time complexity°~, but it could also be memory or some other resource. <i>Best case</i> is the function which performs the minimum number of steps on input data of <i>n</i> elements; <i>worst case</i> is the function which performs the maximum number of steps on input data of size <i>n</i>; <i>average case</i> is the function which performs an average number of steps on input data of <i>n</i> elements.
