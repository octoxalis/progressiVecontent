## automated reasoning

An area of ~°computer science°~ and ~°mathematical logic°~ dedicated to understanding different aspects of ~°reasoning°~. The study of automated reasoning helps produce ~°computer programs°~ that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of ~°artificial intelligence°~, it also has connections with ~°theoretical computer science°~, and even ~°philosophy°~.
