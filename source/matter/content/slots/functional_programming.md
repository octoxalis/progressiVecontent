## functional programming

A ~°programming paradigm°~—a style of building the structure and elements of ~°computer programs°~–that treats ~°computation°~ as the evaluation of ~°mathematical functions°~ and avoids changing-~°state°~ and ~°mutable°~ data. It is a ~°declarative programming°~ paradigm in that programming is done with ~°expressions°~ or ~°declarations°~ instead of ~°statements°~.
