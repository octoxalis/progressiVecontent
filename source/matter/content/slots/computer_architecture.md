:computer architecture:
A set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of ~°computer°~ systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other definitions computer architecture involves ~°instruction set architecture°~ design, ~°microarchitecture°~ design, ~°logic design°~, and ~°implementation°~.
