## data science

An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from ~°data°~ in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to ~°data mining°~. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, ~°information science°~, and ~°computer science°~.
