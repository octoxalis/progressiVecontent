:optical fiber:
A flexible, ~°transparent°~ ~°fiber°~ made by ~°drawing°~ ~°glass°~ (~°silica°~) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a ~°human hair°~. Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in ~°fiber-optic communications°~, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher ~°bandwidths°~ (data rates) than electrical cables. Fibers are used instead of ~°metal°~ wires because signals travel along them with less ~°loss°~; in addition, fibers are immune to ~°electromagnetic interference°~, a problem from which metal wires suffer.
