## algorithmic efficiency

A property of an ~°algorithm°~ which relates to the number of ~°computational resources°~ used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be ~°analyzed°~ to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on usage of different resources. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering ~°productivity°~ for a repeating or continuous process.
