:discrete event simulation (des):
A model of the operation of a system as a ~°discrete°~ sequence of events in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of ~°state°~ in the system. Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; thus the ~°simulation°~ can directly jump in time from one event to the next.
