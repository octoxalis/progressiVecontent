## central processing unit (cpu)

The electronic circuitry within a ~°computer°~ that carries out the ~°instructions°~ of a ~°computer program°~ by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and ~°input/output°~ (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a <i>processor</i>, more specifically to its processing unit and ~°control unit°~ (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as ~°main memory°~ and I/O circuitry.
