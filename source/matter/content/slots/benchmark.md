## benchmark

The act of running a ~°computer program°~, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it. The term <i>benchmark</i> is also commonly utilized for the purposes of elaborately designed benchmarking programs themselves.
