## continuation-passing style (cps)

A style of ~°functional programming°~ in which ~°control°~ is passed explicitly in the form of a ~°continuation°~. This is contrasted with ~°direct style°~, which is the usual style of programming. ~°Gerald Jay Sussman°~ and ~°Guy L. Steele, Jr.°~ coined the phrase in ~°AI Memo°~ 349 (1975), which sets out the first version of the ~°Scheme°~ programming language.
