:machine vision (mv):
The technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, ~°process control°~, and robot guidance, usually in industry. Machine vision refers to many technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a ~°systems engineering°~ discipline can be considered distinct from ~°computer vision°~, a form of ~°computer science°~. It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance.
