:uniform resource locator (url):
A reference to a ~°web resource°~ that specifies its location on a ~°computer network°~ and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of ~°Uniform Resource Identifier°~ (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (~°http°~), but are also used for file transfer (~°ftp°~), email (~°mailto°~), database access (~°JDBC°~), and many other applications.
