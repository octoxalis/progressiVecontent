## computational complexity theory

A subfield of ~째computational science째~ which focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an ~째algorithm째~.
