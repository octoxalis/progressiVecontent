## booting

The procedures implemented in starting up a ~°computer°~ or ~°computer appliance°~ until it can be used. It can be initiated by hardware such as a button press or by a software command. After the power is switched on, the computer is relatively dumb and can read only part of its storage called ~°read-only memory°~. There, a small program is stored called ~°firmware°~. It does ~°power-on self-tests°~ and, most importantly, allows access to other types of memory like a ~°hard disk°~ and ~°main memory°~. The firmware loads bigger ~°programs°~ into the computer's ~°main memory°~ and runs it.
