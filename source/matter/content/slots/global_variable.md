## global variable

In ~°computer programming°~, a variable with global ~°scope°~, meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the program, unless ~°shadowed°~. The set of all global variables is known as the <i>global environment</i> or <i>global state</i>. In compiled languages, global variables are generally ~°static variables°~, whose ~°extent°~ (lifetime) is the entire runtime of the program, though in interpreted languages (including ~°command-line interpreters°~), global variables are generally dynamically allocated when declared, since they are not known ahead of time.
