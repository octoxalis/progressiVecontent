## algorithm design

A method or mathematical process for problem-solving and for engineering ~°algorithms°~. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of ~°operation research°~, such as ~°dynamic programming°~ and ~°divide-and-conquer°~. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns, such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.
