:cleanroom software engineering:
A ~°software development process°~ intended to produce software with a certifiable level of ~°reliability°~. The cleanroom process was originally developed by ~°Harlan Mills°~ and several of his colleagues including Alan Hevner at ~°IBM°~. The focus of the cleanroom process is on defect prevention, rather than defect removal.
