## software design

Is the process by which an ~°agent°~ creates a specification of a ~°software artifact°~, intended to accomplish ~°goals°~, using a set of primitive components and subject to ~°constraints°~. Software design may refer to either "all the activity involved in conceptualizing, framing, implementing, commissioning, and ultimately modifying complex systems" or "the activity following ~°requirements°~ specification and before ~°programming°~, as ... [in] a stylized software engineering process."
