## technical documentation

In engineering, any type of ~°documentation°~ that describes handling, functionality, and architecture of a technical product or a product under ~°development°~ or use. The intended recipient for product technical documentation is both the (proficient) ~°end user°~ as well as the administrator/service or maintenance technician. In contrast to a mere "cookbook" ~°manual°~, technical documentation aims at providing enough information for a user to understand inner and outer dependencies of the product at hand.
