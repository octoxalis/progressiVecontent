:divide and conquer algorithm:
An ~°algorithm design paradigm°~ based on multi-branched ~°recursion°~. A divide-and-conquer ~°algorithm°~ works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
