:agent-based model (abm):
A class of ~°computational models°~ for ~°simulating°~ the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of ~°game theory°~, ~°complex systems°~, ~°emergence°~, ~°computational sociology°~, ~°multi-agent systems°~, and ~°evolutionary programming°~. ~°Monte-Carlo methods°~ are used to introduce randomness.
