## computability theory

also known as <b>recursion theory</b>, is a branch of ~°mathematical logic°~, of ~°computer science°~, and of the ~°theory of computation°~ that originated in the 1930s with the study of ~°computable functions°~ and ~°Turing degrees°~. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, recursion theory overlaps with ~°proof theory°~ and ~°effective descriptive set theory°~.
