## callback

Any ~째executable code째~ that is passed as an ~째argument째~ to other code that is expected to "call back" (execute) the argument at a given time. This execution may be immediate, as in a <i>synchronous callback</i>, or it might happen at a later time, as in an <i>asynchronous callback</i>.
