## artifact

One of many kinds of tangible by-products produced during the development of ~°software°~. Some artifacts (e.g. ~°use cases°~, ~°class diagrams°~, and other ~°Unified Modeling Language°~ (UML) models, requirements, and design documents) help describe the function, architecture, and design of software. Other artifacts are concerned with the process of development itself—such as project plans, business cases, and risk assessments.
