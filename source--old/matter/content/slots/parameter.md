:parameter:
In ~°computer programming°~, a special kind of ~°variable°~, used in a ~°subroutine°~ to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are the values of the arguments (often called <i>actual arguments</i> or <i>actual parameters</i>) with which the subroutine is going to be called/invoked. An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the ~°definition of a subroutine°~, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call are evaluated, and the resulting values can be assigned to the corresponding parameters.
