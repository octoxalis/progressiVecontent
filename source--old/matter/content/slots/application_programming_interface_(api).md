:application programming interface (api):
A set of ~°subroutine°~ definitions, ~°communication protocols°~, and tools for building ~°software°~. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a ~°computer program°~ by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the ~°programmer°~.
