:interface:
A shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a ~°computer system°~ exchange information. The exchange can be between ~°software°~, ~°computer hardware°~, ~°peripheral°~ devices, ~°humans°~, and combinations of these. Some computer hardware devices, such as a ~°touchscreen°~, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.
