:domain name system (dns):
A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the ~°Internet°~ or to a private network. It associates various information with ~°domain names°~ assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical ~°IP addresses°~ needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying ~°network protocols°~. By providing a worldwide, ~°distributed°~ ~°directory service°~, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.
