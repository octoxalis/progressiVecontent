:java:
A ~°general-purpose°~ ~°programming language°~ that is ~°class-based°~, ~°object-oriented°~(although not a <i>pure</i> OO language), and designed to have as few implementation ~°dependencies°~ as possible. It is intended to let ~°application developers°~ "~°write once, run anywhere°~" (WORA), meaning that ~°compiled°~ Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
