:conditional:
A feature of a ~°programming language°~ which performs different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified ~°Boolean°~ condition evaluates to true or false. Apart from the case of ~°branch predication°~, this is always achieved by selectively altering the ~°control flow°~ based on some condition.
