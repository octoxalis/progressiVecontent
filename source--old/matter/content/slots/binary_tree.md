:binary tree:
A ~°tree°~ ~°data structure°~ in which each node has at most two ~°children°~, which are referred to as the <i>left child</i> and the <i>right child</i>. A ~°recursive definition°~ using just ~°set theory°~ notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a ~°tuple°~ (<i>L</i>, <i>S</i>, <i>R</i>), where <i>L</i> and <i>R</i> are binary trees or the ~°empty set°~ and <i>S</i> is a ~°singleton set°~. Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.
