:secondary storage:
Also known as <i>external memory</i> or <i>auxiliary storage</i>, differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its ~°input/output°~ channels to access secondary storage and transfer the desired data to primary storage. Secondary storage is non-volatile (retaining data when power is shut off). Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage because secondary storage is less expensive.
