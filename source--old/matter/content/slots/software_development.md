:software development:
Is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, ~°programming°~, ~°documenting°~, ~°testing°~, and ~°bug fixing°~ involved in creating and maintaining ~°applications°~, ~°frameworks°~, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and ~°maintaining°~ the ~°source code°~, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and ~°structured°~ process. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.
