:abstract data type (adt):
A ~°mathematical model°~ for ~°data types°~ in which a data type is defined by its behavior (~°semantics°~) from the point of view of a ~°user°~ of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
