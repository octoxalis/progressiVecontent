:edge device:
A device which provides an entry point into enterprise or service provider core networks. Examples include ~°routers°~, routing ~°switches°~, ~°integrated access devices°~ (IADs), multiplexers, and a variety of ~°metropolitan area network°~ (MAN) and ~°wide area network°~ (WAN) access devices.  Edge devices also provide connections into carrier and service provider networks. An edge device that connects a ~°local area network°~ to a high speed switch or backbone (such as an ATM switch) may be called an edge concentrator.
