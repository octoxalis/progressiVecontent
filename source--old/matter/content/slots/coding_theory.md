:coding theory:
The study of the properties of ~°codes°~ and their respective fitness for specific applications. Codes are used for ~°data compression°~, ~°cryptography°~, ~°error detection and correction°~, ~°data transmission°~ and ~°data storage°~. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as ~°information theory°~, ~°electrical engineering°~, ~°mathematics°~, ~°linguistics°~, and ~°computer science°~—for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data.
