:waveform audio file format:
An ~°audio file format°~ standard, developed by ~°Microsoft°~ and ~°IBM°~, for storing an audio bitstream on ~°PCs°~. It is an application of the ~°Resource Interchange File Format°~ (RIFF) ~°bitstream format°~ method for storing data in "chunks", and thus is also close to the ~°8SVX°~ and the ~°AIFF°~ format used on ~°Amiga°~ and ~°Macintosh°~ computers, respectively. It is the main format used on ~°Microsoft Windows°~ systems for raw and typically uncompressed audio. The usual bitstream encoding is the ~°linear pulse-code modulation°~ (LPCM) format.
