:user interface (ui):
The space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' ~°decision-making°~ process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer ~°operating systems°~, hand ~°tools°~, ~°heavy machinery°~ operator controls, and ~°process°~ controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ~°ergonomics°~ and ~°psychology°~.
