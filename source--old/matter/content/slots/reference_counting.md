:reference counting:
A programming technique of storing the number of ~°references°~, ~°pointers°~, or ~°handles°~ to a resource, such as an object, a block of memory, disk space, and others. In ~°garbage collection°~ algorithms, reference counts may be used to deallocate objects which are no longer needed.
