:modem:
A ~°hardware°~ device that converts data into a format suitable for a ~°transmission medium°~ so that it can be transmitted from one computer to another (historically along telephone wires). A modem ~°modulates°~ one or more ~°carrier wave°~ signals to encode ~°digital information°~ for transmission and ~°demodulates°~ signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a ~°signal°~ that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from ~°light-emitting diodes°~ to ~°radio°~. A common type of modem is one that turns the ~°digital data°~ of a ~°computer°~ into modulated ~°electrical signal°~ for transmission over ~°telephone lines°~ and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.
