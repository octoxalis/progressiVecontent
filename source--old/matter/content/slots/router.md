:router:
A ~°networking device°~ that forwards ~°data packets°~ between ~°computer networks°~. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the ~°Internet°~.  Data sent through the internet, such as a ~°web page°~ or ~°email°~, is in the form of data packets.   A packet is typically ~°forwarded°~ from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an ~°internetwork°~ (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination ~°node°~.
