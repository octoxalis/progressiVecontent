:class:
In ~°object-oriented programming°~, an extensible program-code-template for creating ~°objects°~, providing initial values for state (~°member variables°~) and implementations of behavior (member functions or ~°methods°~). In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default ~°constructor°~ of the class (a ~°subroutine°~ that creates objects), and as the ~°type°~ of objects generated by ~°instantiating°~ the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.
