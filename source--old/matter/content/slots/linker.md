:linker:
 or link editor, is a computer ~°utility°~ program that takes one or more ~°object files°~ generated by a ~°compiler°~ or an ~°assembler°~ and combines them into a single ~°executable°~ file, ~°library°~ file, or another 'object' file.  A simpler version that writes its output directly to memory is called the <i>loader</i>, though ~°loading°~ is typically considered a separate process.
