:methodology:
In ~°software engineering°~, a software development process is the process of dividing ~°software development°~ work into distinct phases to improve ~°design°~, ~°product management°~, and ~°project management°~. It is also known as a software development life cycle (SDLC). The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific ~°deliverables°~ and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.
