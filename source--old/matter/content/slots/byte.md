:byte:
A ~°unit of digital information°~ that most commonly consists of eight ~°bits°~, representing a ~°binary number°~. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single ~°character°~ of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest ~°addressable°~ unit of ~°memory°~ in many ~°computer architectures°~.
