:internet bot:
A ~°software application°~ that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the ~°Internet°~. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. The largest use of bots is in ~°web spidering°~ (<i>web crawler</i>), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a ~°human°~.
