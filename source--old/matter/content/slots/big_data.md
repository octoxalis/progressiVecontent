:big data:
A term used to refer to ~°data sets°~ that are too large or complex for traditional ~°data-processing°~ ~°application software°~ to adequately deal with. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater ~°statistical power°~, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher ~°false discovery rate°~.
