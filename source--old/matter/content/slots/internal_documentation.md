:internal documentation:
Computer ~°software°~ is said to have Internal Documentation if the notes on how and why various parts of code operate is included within the ~°source code°~ as comments.  It is often combined with meaningful ~°variable°~ names with the intention of providing potential future programmers a means of understanding the workings of the code. This contrasts with external ~°documentation°~, where programmers keep their notes and explanations in a separate document.
