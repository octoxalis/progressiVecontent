:parallel computing:
A type of ~°computation°~ in which many calculations or the execution of ~°processes°~ are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: ~°bit-level°~, ~°instruction-level°~, ~°data°~, and ~°task parallelism°~.
