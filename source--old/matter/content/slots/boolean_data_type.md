:boolean data type:
A ~°data type°~ that has one of two possible values (usually denoted <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>), intended to represent the two ~°truth values°~ of ~°logic°~ and ~°Boolean algebra°~. It is named after ~°George Boole°~, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid-19th century. The Boolean data type is primarily associated with ~°conditional°~ statements, which allow different actions by changing ~°control flow°~ depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean <i>condition</i> evaluates to true or false. It is a special case of a more general <i>logical data type</i> (see ~°probabilistic logic°~)—i.e. logic need not always be Boolean.
