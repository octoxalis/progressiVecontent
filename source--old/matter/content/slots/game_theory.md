:game theory:
The study of ~°mathematical models°~ of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of ~°social science°~, as well as in ~°logic°~ and ~°computer science°~. Originally, it addressed ~°zero-sum games°~, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an ~°umbrella term°~ for the ~°science°~ of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.
