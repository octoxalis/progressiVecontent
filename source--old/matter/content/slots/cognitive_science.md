:cognitive science:
The interdisciplinary, ~°scientific°~ study of the ~°mind°~ and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of ~°cognition°~ (in a broad sense). Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform ~°information°~. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, ~°artificial intelligence°~, ~°philosophy°~, ~°neuroscience°~, and anthropology.
