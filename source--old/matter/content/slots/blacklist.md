:blacklist:
In ~°computing°~, a basic ~°access control°~ mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, ~°URLs°~, ~°IP addresses°~, ~°domain names°~, file ~°hashes°~, etc.), except those explicitly mentioned in a list of prohibited elements. Those items on the list are denied access. The opposite is a ~°whitelist°~, which means only items on the list are allowed through whatever gate is being used while all other elements are blocked. A ~°greylist°~ contains items that are temporarily blocked (or temporarily allowed) until an additional step is performed.
